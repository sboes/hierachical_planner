    "# Final Report – Hierarchical Motion Planning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This report documents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a **hierarchical motion planning system** developed as part of a project assignment. The objective was to investigate a layered planning strategy that separates global structural planning from local geometric planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system is based on a **two-level architecture**, where a visibility-based roadmap planner identifies high-level paths, and a configurable local planner (Standard PRM or LazyPRM) verifies feasibility through bounded subplanning regions. The results highlight the strengths and limitations of this hierarchical approach in planar environments with increasing complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. System Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The hierarchical planner is implemented via the class `HierarchicalPlanner`, which internally manages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **global planner** based on the `VisibilityPRM` class.\n",
    "- A **local planner**, instantiated per query segment, chosen from `BasicPRM` or `LazyPRM`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Planning Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The global planner computes a high-level path over a visibility graph (`plan_path(start, goal, config_global)`).\n",
    "2. Each segment \\( (q_i, q_{i+1}) \\) of the global path is passed to a fresh local planner instance.\n",
    "3. The local planner attempts to find a detailed sub-path between the segment endpoints, restricted to a padded **bounding box** around the segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bounding limits are calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{local\\_limits}_x = \\left[ \\max(c_x - p, x_{\\min}),\\ \\min(c_x + p, x_{\\max}) \\right]\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{local\\_limits}_y = \\left[ \\max(c_y - p, y_{\\min}),\\ \\min(c_y + p, y_{\\max}) \\right]\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\( c \\) is the segment center and \\( p \\) is a padding value scaled by segment length.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Global Planner: VisibilityPRM\n",
    "\n",
    "- Guards and connectors are added based on mutual line-of-sight checks.\n",
    "- A roadmap is built via `VisibilityPRM._learn_roadmap(ntry)`.\n",
    "- Start and goal are connected to existing guards if line-of-sight is valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Local Planners\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a) BasicPRM\n",
    "\n",
    "- Samples nodes within the defined limits.\n",
    "- Adds edges based on radius-limited neighborhood and collision-free straight lines.\n",
    "- Connects start/goal via `_connect_to_graph(...)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b) LazyPRM\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adds edges without checking for collisions.\n",
    "- Defers validation until a path is extracted (`_check_path_lazy(...)`).\n",
    "- Supports roadmap growth over `maxIterations`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both planners implement the method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "plan_path(start_list, goal_list, config) → path (as node IDs)\n",

    "### 3.1 Simple Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "A 2-DoF environment was used to observe planner behavior and correctness. The global path and each local sub-path were animated and overlaid on the obstacle map.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Complex Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "We created scenarios with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Planar manipulators of 4, 8, and 12 DoF (through `BasicPRMRobot`)\n",
    "- Varying density and structure of obstacles\n",
    "- Narrow passages and multi-modal solutions\n",

    "\n",
    "### 6.1 Suitability of Hierarchical Planning\n",
    "\n",
    "While not universally optimal, hierarchical planning is beneficial when:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Global structure can be exploited (e.g., visibility-based decomposition)\n",
    "- Local planning is expensive or dimensionally constrained\n",
    "\n",
    "The localized planning around each edge reduces unnecessary full-space sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.2 Failure Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- Local planner might fail due to undersampling or bounding box being too small.\n",
    "- Global planner might produce paths that pass too close to obstacles, stressing local planners.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.3 Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adaptive bounding regions based on environment density\n",
    "- Retry strategies for failed segments\n",
    "- Integration of trajectory smoothing (e.g., CHOMP, STOMP)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The project successfully demonstrated a modular hierarchical planning approach using PRM variants and visibility-based decomposition. The separation between structure (global) and feasibility (local) improved flexibility, though it also introduced dependency on local planner robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "LazyPRM was efficient in open environments, while BasicPRM showed greater consistency in dense scenes. The overall system provides a strong foundation for further research in hybrid motion planning.\n",
